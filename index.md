## Important Announcement: Sunsetting J2Store Development

Dear J2Store Community,

We have always strived to deliver quality eCommerce extension through J2Store, and we deeply appreciate the trust and support you have shown us over the years. However, after careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to sunset the development of J2Store and its associated extensions.

This decision has not come easily. The rising costs of development, combined with dwindling revenue, have made it increasingly challenging for us to continue offering the level innovation that you deserve. As a result, we have chosen to sunset J2Store’s development, but keep it as open-source software for you to fork and build upon.

### What this means for you:

- The J2Store repository has been archived, and the project will no longer be actively maintained.
- All open issues in the repository have been closed.
- J2Store will remain available for the community to explore, fork, and build upon.

We want to thank everyone who has been a part of the J2Store journey—your feedback, contributions, and enthusiasm have been invaluable.

Thank you for being a part of this journey with us. We hope that by open-sourcing the project, J2Store can continue to live on in new and exciting ways.

### What are the next steps?
Exciting News!
J2Store has been forked and evolved into [J2Commerce](https://www.j2commerce.com/), an initiative spearheaded by Adam and Oliver from the Joomla community. Head over to the J2Commerce website for the latest updates and more information.
